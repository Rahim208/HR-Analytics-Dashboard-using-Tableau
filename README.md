I recently created an HR Analytics Dashboard using Tableau to explore key metrics on employee demographics, turnover, and role distribution. This dashboard provides an interactive view into workforce data, helping HR teams make data-driven decisions for better workforce planning and retention strategies.

The visuals cover:
â—¾ Employee Count: Overall, active, and inactive employees.
â—¾ Gender Breakdown: Insight into gender distribution across the organization.
â—¾ Age Bracket: Employee counts segmented by age groups.
â—¾ Education Level: Analysis based on different educational backgrounds.
â—¾ Job Role Distribution: Visualizing the workforce across various roles.
This project has been an exciting challenge and a rewarding learning experience. Tableauâ€™s power in transforming raw data into actionable insights never ceases to amaze me!
